# Nadine Khattab

I am a Computer Science student at the Arab Academy For Science And Technology (Expected 2026) with a strong focus on Machine Learning and Cloud Computing. I am passionate about building scalable, intelligent software solutions and applying my skills to solve challenging problems.

## About Me

* I am currently focused on **Machine Learning**, with project experience in building and training **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with TensorFlow and Keras for image classification.
* I have hands-on experience architecting and deploying **serverless pipelines on AWS**, including an AI-powered resume ranker and an automated translator API.
* My background includes developing a variety of data-driven models, such as a **sales forecasting model for Walmart** using time-series analysis and a **movie recommendation system** using collaborative filtering.
* I am driven by the full software development lifecycle, from initial design and data processing to final deployment and maintenance.
